## In this project, I implemented 3 web pages with Bootstrap. Used HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap

## Objective: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

# Requirements
  * Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen is 768px.
  *Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px. 
  * button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
